# Mini Project: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics  ## 
📌 Project Overview This project explores both **Descriptive** and **Inferential** statistics — the foundation of data science and analytics.   It covers key concepts such as central tendency, dispersion, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, IQR
  - Data types and levels of measurement
- **Inferential Statistics**
  - Confidence Intervals
  - Hypothesis Testing (Z-test)
  - Population vs Sample concepts

## 📊 Learning Objectives
- Compute and interpret summary statistics manually and using Python.
- Apply inferential methods to estimate and test population parameters.
- Visualize distributions using boxplots and understand outliers.

## 🧾 Dataset
A small, structured dataset of numerical values (synthetic or real-world) is used to demonstrate:
- Mean, median, and mode
- Confidence interval estimation
- Hypothesis testing for mean differences

## 📂 Files Included
- `Descriptive_Inferential_Statistics.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
- `Mini_Project_Descriptive_Inferential_Statistics.docx` — Detailed report with step-by-step explanations.
- `README.md` — Project summary.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- Descriptive statistics help summarize large datasets efficiently.
- Inferential statistics allow predictions about populations from samples.
- Real-world decisions rely heavily on hypothesis testing and confidence levels.
